    "#### A driver is looking for inexpensive parking on the way to his destination. The parking area contains $N$ spaces, and a garage at the end. The driver starts at space 0 and traverses the parking spaces sequentially, i.e., from space $k$ he goes next to space $k+1$, etc. Each parking space $k$ costs $c(k)$ and is free (unoccupied) with probability $p(k)$ independently of whether other parking spaces are free or not. If the driver reaches the last parking space and does not park there, he must park at the garage, which costs $C$. The driver can observe whether a parking space is free only when he reaches it, and then, if it is free, he makes a decision to park in that space or not to park and check the next space. The problem is to find the minimum expected cost parking policy."
